# Weather Dashboard Trip Planner

## Description
Program to plan a trip based on the upcoming local weather of searched cities. The motivation for the program is to help plan for future trips based on the current weather and the next 5 day forecast. Through the program I learned how to use API calls. This program also uses local storage and bootstrap.

## Usage

The user will enter a city name in the input search bar and click the search button. The forecast will be displayed on screen. The searched cities will also add a button to the screen if it is a unique search that has not been saved to local storage.
